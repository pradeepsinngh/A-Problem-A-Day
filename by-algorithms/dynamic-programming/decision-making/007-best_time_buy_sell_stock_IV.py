# Prob: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
