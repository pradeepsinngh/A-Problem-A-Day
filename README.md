#### Time and Space Complexity:
| Data Structure |     Insertion  | Deletion      | Search    |  Access |
| :---           |     :---:      |    :---:      |    :---:  |    ---: |
| Array          |   O (n)        | O (n)         |  O (n)    | O (1)   |
| Max Heap       | O (log n)      | O (log n)     |   O(1) (max element)   | |
| Min Heap       | O (log n)      | O (log n)     |   O(1) (max element)   | |
| Binary Search Tree    | O(log n)       |  O(log n)   |   O(log n)        | |
| Linked List           | O (n)       | O (n)     |      O (n)     | |

| Data Structure |     Push       | Pop           | Top       |
| :---           |     :---:      |    :---:      |      ---: |
| Stack          | O(1)           | O(1)          |     O(1)  |
| Queue          | O(1)           | O(1)          |   O(1)    |

#### Sorting Algoritms 
| Sort |     Time  | Space  |
| :--- |     :---: |   ---: |
| Bubble Sort | O(n^2)  | O(1)|
| Insertion Sort | O(n^2)  | O(1)|
| Selection Sort | O(n^2)  | O(1)|
| Quick Sort|O(n log(n)) | O(log n) |
| Merge Sort |O(n log(n)) |  O(n)|
| Heap Sort |O(n log(n)) |  O(1)|
| Bucket Sort |O(n + k) |  O(n)|
