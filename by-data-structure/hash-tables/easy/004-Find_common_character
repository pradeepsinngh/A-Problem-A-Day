# Prob: Find Common Characters
# Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings 
# within the list (including duplicates).  

# For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times 
# in the final answer.

# Sol1: Use Hashmaps

Time Complx: O(N)
Space Complx: O(N)
