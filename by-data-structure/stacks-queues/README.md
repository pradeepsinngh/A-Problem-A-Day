## Points to remember:

1. Stacks and Queues are linear data structure [i.e. one element after the other]
2. Flexible size [No need to allocate initially].
3. Stacks:
  - LIFO [last in first out]
  - Support 3 operations: PUSH, POP, PEEK
  - If stack is empty, pop returns null or throws an exception.
4. Queues: 
   - FIFO [first in, first out]
   -
