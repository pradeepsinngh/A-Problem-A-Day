## Points to remember:

1. Stacks and Queues are linear data structure [i.e. one element after the other]
2. Flexible size [No need to allocate initially].
3. Stacks:
  - LIFO [last in first out]
  - Supports 3 operations: PUSH, POP, PEEK
  - If stack is empty, pop returns null or throws an exception.
4. Queues: 
  - FIFO [first in, first out]
  - Supports 2 opperation: ENQUEUE, DEQUEUE
  - If queue is empty, dequeue returns null or throws an exception.
   
  - **DEQUE**: Double ended queue, is a doubly linked list in which all insertion and deletion operations are from one of the two ends of the list.
   - Insertion from front is called - Push
   - Insertion from back is called  - Inject
   - Deletion from front is called - Pop
   - Deletion from back is called - Eject
